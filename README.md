# Extreme Tuesday: TCR

Attending XTC on 8 January 2018: https://www.meetup.com/eXtreme-Tuesday-Club-XTC/events/wcwwmqyzcbcb/

This was an interesting event, and sparked plenty of lively debate.

This exercise was done with Cristina Verdi and Solange U. Gasengayire (who both picked up basic C# really quickly).
